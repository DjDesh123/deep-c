# Phase 1 Study Plan (April 20th - May 11th)

This study plan is designed to help you master the basics of C programming in the first phase, from setting up your development environment to understanding memory management and working with pointers. Follow this plan to build a solid foundation before moving on to more complex topics.

**Focus**: Advanced Data Types, Structs, Pointers, Memory Management

### **Monday** (April 27th)
- Study **structs** and **enums** in C.
- Create a program using structs to store related data.

### **Tuesday** (April 28th)

### **Wednesday** (April 29th)
- Study **dynamic memory allocation** using `malloc` and `free`.
- Implement a program that uses dynamic memory allocation.

### **Thursday** (April 30th)

- Practice using pointers with arrays, and explore the relationship between arrays and pointers.

### **Friday** (May 1st)
- Review **memory management** concepts: stack vs heap memory.
- Implement a program using memory management principles.

### **Saturday** (May 2nd)
- Work on **pointer functions** and passing pointers to functions.
- Solve problems using pointers and dynamic memory allocation.

## **Week 3: May 4th - May 10th**  
**Focus**: Advanced Topics in C, File Handling, Debugging, and Error Handling

### **Monday** (May 4th)
- Study **file handling** in C (reading and writing files).
- Implement a program that reads from and writes to a file.

### **Tuesday** (May 5th)
- Learn about **error handling** in C: `errno`, `perror`, `assert`.
- Write a program with basic error checking and handling.

### **Wednesday** (May 6th)
- Study **debugging** techniques in C using `gdb` or CLion's built-in debugger.
- Debug a simple program with intentional errors.

### **Thursday** (May 7th)
- Learn about **bitwise operators** in C.

### **Friday** (May 8th)
- Review all concepts from the week.
- Work on debugging and testing your code.

### **Saturday** (May 9th)
- Write a project that incorporates **file handling**, **error checking**, and **debugging**.
- Focus on clean code and clear comments.

### **Sunday** (May 10th)
- Final review of all concepts from Phase 1.
- Refactor and clean up the projects you've worked on during this phase.

## **Week 4: May 11th - May 17th**  
**Focus**: Final Review, LeetCode Challenges, Project Refinement

### **Monday** (May 11th)
- Review all C programming concepts covered in Phase 1.
- Go over your **GitHub repository** and update your README.

### **Tuesday** (May 12th)
- Complete a series of **LeetCode** problems covering all topics from this phase (arrays, pointers, loops, structs).

### **Wednesday** (May 13th)
- Focus on **code optimization** and **memory efficiency**.
- Review best practices for writing clean and optimized code.

### **Thursday** (May 14th)
- Create or refine a **final project** using concepts from Phase 1.
- Implement everything youâ€™ve learned, such as structs, pointers, file handling, and debugging.

### **Friday** (May 15th)
- Continue working on your final project.
- Add comments and write unit tests for your project.

### **Saturday** (May 16th)
- Prepare for **portfolio review**: Make sure your GitHub is up to date.
- Reflect on your learning progress so far.

### **Sunday** (May 17th)
- Final revision and cleanup of all projects in Phase 1.
- Prepare a **summary** of your progress and create a list of things you want to focus on for the next phase.

## **Additional Notes**  
- **GitHub Portfolio**: Ensure each project has clear documentation, unit tests, and the code is modular and well-organized.  
- **LeetCode & Practice**: Continuously practice coding on LeetCode or other coding challenge platforms.  
- **Refactoring**: Always aim to refactor your code to improve readability, efficiency, and structure.  
- **Review**: At the end of each week, take time to review the concepts and refine your understanding.
