Absolutely. Here's a **daily learning plan** to help you study DSA in C while continuing with your other work like project building and general C practice. This is designed to be digestible and steady to reinforce concepts through repetition and practice.

### ðŸ”¥ **DSA in C â€“ Week 1 Plan** ðŸ”¥
(Focus: Arrays, Strings, and Core Concepts)

#### **Day 1: Arrays â€“ Basics**
- Learn: Traversing, inserting, deleting
- Code: Reverse an array, find the maximum/minimum
- Practice: `reverse_array`, `insert_at_index`, `delete_at_index`

#### **Day 2: Arrays â€“ 2D Arrays**
- Learn: How 2D arrays work in memory
- Code: Matrix addition, transpose of a matrix
- Apply this to improve your understanding of the Tic Tac Toe project

#### **Day 3: Strings â€“ Basics**
- Learn: How strings are stored in C
- Code: Implement `strlen`, `strcpy`, and `strcmp`
- Practice: Check if two strings are anagrams

#### **Day 4: Strings â€“ Problems**
- Code: Palindrome check, string reversal, vowel count
- Learn: Difference between character arrays and pointers to char

#### **Day 5: Pointers and Dynamic Memory (malloc, free)**
- Learn: Basics of pointers, pointer arithmetic
- Code: Dynamic array allocation, pointer-based string handling
- Practice: Write a program to resize an array using `realloc`

#### **Day 6: Application Day**
- Revisit: Tic Tac Toe and improve your code based on what youâ€™ve learned
- Try: Create a basic menu-driven array or string app

#### **Day 7: Mini Challenge & Review**
- Practice: Solve 2-3 problems on arrays or strings from HackerRank or LeetCode
- Review: Key learnings from the week, take handwritten notes or code snippets

### Want Week 2 Next?
Week 2 would go deeper into **Linked Lists**, **Recursion**, and **Stack/Queue** basics.
