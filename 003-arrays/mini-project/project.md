# Notes on the project

From what I have realised is that this was a good challenge as I found sections in my code that was difficult for me even tho this project should of been fairly simple.
This project also has shown me that a weak spot of mine that i need to improve on in traversing a 2D array and need more practice to be able to do that more efficently.

The easier parts of this project was setting up both of the players and creating the while loops but over closer inspection it causes an infinite loop and wasnt as effiecnt as I thought it could of been.
On sunday I will be adding to this for the evaluation and refractoring of all these notes to see if the program can be made more optimal from the experiences i gained.


This was a project that stumpt me in a my start point of my programming joureny and even though I did struggle with the traversal the rest of this project was fairly easier now its time to optomise and fill in my new optomisation later on the week.
