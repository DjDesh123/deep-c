# Project evaluations


With this project I created a  cli based adventure game.
this was a little more fun to create as I had to learn a lot more of the control structures in C and then I can make the program more fluid and fun to use.
I learnt how to use random in c which was a new feature that I never learnt how to use it so it was quite interesting in seeing how it functions and to implement it in my code.


## Refactoring of the code ideas
Next time I want to write a more in depth layer of to the cli game by adding maybe some delays and more options and mechanics to look at whislt playing in the free time i get to refactor.
