# Cli-adventure-game

---
This project is a simple adventure game that is cli based.After the refacotring of this project i used , pointers ,struts and enums in differenet sections of my code whilst also keeping a clearn control structure logic.

---

## Tools I used

- structs to hold the character's attributes
- if statement to move the scenario forward depending on what happened in the code
- enums to add readability to my code 
- pointers to effect the attributes directly and be more memory efficient.
- for loop to interate over a certain period of time 
- while loop to handle all scenarios and keep looping till the game ends
